DO YOU ENCOUNTER THE SKIN PROBLEM AS BELOW : 

Group '1' Oily Skin 
Symptoms of the Oily Skin as : 
 a) A shiny or greasy appearance.
 b) Very large or obvious pores on the skin.
 c) Skin that looks thick or rough
 d) Occasional persistent pimples.
 e) Clogged pores and blackheads.

The Skin care Consultancy advise for your Skin Problem :
•	Important of hydration 
 Oiliness does not mean that your face is hydrated. All skin types need hydration. This helps to balance them, as well as maintain their natural characteristics and protective barriers. 
•	Make intelligent choices in your diet.
 The better you eat, the more beautiful your skin. Avoid fatty and fried foods because this can increase oiliness and the incidence of pimples.  
 Include more carrots, cantaloupe, and spinach in your meal - high in vitamin A and can actually slow oil production.

The Skin care Consultancy advise for your Skin Problem :
•	Moisturize 
 Moisturizers provide a seal over your skin to keep water from escaping. Apply moisturizer several times a day and after bathing. 
•	Use warm water and limit bath time.
 Long showers or baths and hot water remove oils from your skin. Limit your bath or shower to five to 10 minutes and use warm, not hot, water.
•	Avoid harsh, drying soaps.
 It's best to use cleansing creams or gentle skin cleansers and bath or shower gels with added moisturizers. Choose mild soaps that have added oils and fats. 
 Avoid deodorant and antibacterial detergents, fragrance, and alcohol.

The Skin care Consultancy advise for your Skin Problem :
•	Use the gentle facial cleanser 
 Your skin’s surface becomes covered with dirt, excess oils, and impurities throughout the day. Make sure to use a facial cleanser that will help mattify your 
 oily T-zone without over-drying your cheeks and under-eye area. 
•	Hydrate your skin. 
 Regardless of your skin type, using a moisturizer is essential to keep your skin looking and feeling healthy. 
 For combination skin, your best bet is to opt for a moisturizer that’s hydrating while not feeling heavy or greasy.

Group '4' Sensitive Skin

 c) Your Skin is dry 
 d) Get sunburn easily 

The Skin care Consultancy advise for your Skin Problem :
•	Cleanse your skin with micellar water 
 When it comes to sensitive skin, it’s a good idea to stay away from foaming cleansers. Instead, try micellar water, a gentle, no-rinse cleansing option. 
 Micellar water is powered by tiny micelles
•	Never skip out on moisturizer. 
 While you may be nervous about layering on extra skin care products if you have sensitive skin, skipping out on moisturizer shouldn’t be an option. 
 Llightweight cream helps strengthen and repair skin barrier to help resist visible signs of aging that a weakened barrier can accentuate.
